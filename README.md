# Decision Tree

Custom decision tree queries using Svelte

It works with the user, or the url, providing a tree of questions. When you select the question it jumps to the next question.

You can host your questions anywhere as either a URL to a JSON or a base64 encoded JSON

For data format refer to `src/Model.ts` and the examples folder.

It doesn't check for data validation, it just assumes that is right.
